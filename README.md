      <p><strong>Hello, my name is Soraya Ezazipour.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at Oklahoma State University, specializing in optimization, network analysis, and data-driven decision making. My academic and professional background integrates operations research, statistics, and data science to address complex and impactful real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research spans convex and non-convex optimization, combinatorial and integer programming, and network optimization. I also work extensively with machine learning techniques, and I am proficient in both C++ and Python. My work applies these methodologies across diverse domains including economics, supply chain management, healthcare, and public policy—most notably, political redistricting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly passionate about developing innovative, practical solutions through mathematical modeling and algorithm design. I bring a rigorous understanding of algorithms and data structures and continuously seek out challenging opportunities to contribute to interdisciplinary research and data-driven decision support systems.
      </p>
