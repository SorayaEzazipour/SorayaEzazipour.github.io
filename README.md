      <p><strong>Hello, my name is Soraya Ezazipour.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I hold a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from Oklahoma State University. My work focuses on mixed-integer programming, network optimization, and data-driven decision making. I apply techniques from operations research, statistics, and data science to solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also worked with machine learning techniques and have experience in both C++ and Python. I enjoy developing practical solutions through mathematical modeling and algorithm design. With a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures, I continually seek opportunities to work on challenging projects that bridge theory and application.
