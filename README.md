      <p><strong>Hello, my name is Soraya Ezazipour.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I hold a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from Oklahoma State University. My work focuses on mixed integer programming, network optimization, and data-driven decision making. I use tools from operations research, statistics, and data science to solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also worked with machine learning techniques and have experience in both C++ and Python. I am interested in applying these methods across a range of domains, including economics, supply chain management, healthcare, and public policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy building practical solutions using mathematical models and algorithms. I have a strong background in algorithms and data structures, and I’m always looking for challenging projects that combine theory with real-world impact.
      </p>
