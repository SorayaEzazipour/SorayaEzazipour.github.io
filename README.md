      <p><strong>Hello, my name is Soraya Ezazipour.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I hold a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering with a strong foundation in operations research, statistics, and data science.  
        My academic and professional background includes hands-on experience in convex and non-convex optimization, combinatorial optimization, integer programming, and network optimization.  
        I also work with machine learning techniques and am proficient in C++ and Python. I enjoy applying these skills to solve real-world problems in domains such as economics, supply chain management, healthcare, and finance.  
        I have a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures and am continually seeking opportunities to develop practical, data-driven solutions that generate meaningful impact.
