      <p><strong>Hello, my name is Soraya Ezazipour.</strong></p>
      <p>
        I hold a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from Oklahoma State University. My work focuses on mixed-integer programming, network optimization, and data-driven decision making. I apply techniques from operations research, statistics, and data science to address real-world challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have experience with machine learning techniques and have worked with both C++ and Python. I enjoy developing practical solutions through mathematical modeling and algorithm design. With a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures, I continually seek opportunities to contribute to challenging projects that bridge theory and real-world impact.
