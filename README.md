Hi! https://github.com/SorayaEzazipour/SorayaEzazipour.github.io/blob/master/my_pic_informs.jpg
========================================================================================================================================

I hold a Ph.D. in industrial engineering with a strong foundation in operations research, statistics, and data science. I have hands-on experience with convex and non-convex optimization, combinatorial optimization, integer programming, and network optimization. I also work with machine learning and am proficient in C++ and Python. I enjoy applying these skills to real-world problems across areas like economics, supply chain management, healthcare, and finance. I have a thorough understanding of algorithms and data structures. I am always eager to take on new challenges and create practical, data-driven solutions that make a difference.
